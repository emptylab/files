Portability

## Use snake_case to separate words in file names because: 

Automation
* It's easier to parse `snake_case` than either camelCase or PascalCase.
* It's safer to parse `snake_case` than skewer-case in languages that interpret dash as subtract.

## Use Telegram for chat because:

Private - it's encrypted.

Simple - it does one thing well.

CLI - it supports command line
